# IDAssignment2

Idea:
To create a fitness app that benefits the user in terms of hitting their calorie goals and watch the weather

Features:
-Login and Signup feature, this is so that users data will be stored and can be re-used and updated. This is done using javascript,localstorage and session storage. Users will have to login in order to access certain features.

-Calorie Tracker feature, depending on the users gender, they will be given a reccomended calorie goal, the user can log their meals and their calorie worth which will be deducted from the goal.

-Weather feature, the user is able to search anywhere in the world and retrieve the weather data, this is to let the users plan their workout for exmaple a run in the park and to see if the weather conditions align.

Technologies:

-used jquery to update html

-used bootstrap to set up nav bar and wrap content in containers, this makes the website naturally responsive

-used API from https://openweathermap.org/current to program the weather app

-used local storage and session storage to store data and program login function.

Deployment:
1. You will have to register for a github account and clone this project using this link https://github.com/JamesYapXH/IDAssignment2.git

2.This what the website will currently look like https://jamesyapxh.github.io/IDAssignment2/

3.You can add your own attributes and data by editing the class in signup.js

4.images can be changed by renaming the img tags in the HTML codes
